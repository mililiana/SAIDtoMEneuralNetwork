# SAIDtoMEneuralNetwork

## AI-Doctor Documentation Repository

Welcome to SAIDtoME Documentation repository! This project is dedicated to creating an AI-driven medical diagnostic system that can identify diseases based on input symptoms. Our team ESPRIT has developed a neural network to bring this idea to life.

### Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build an AI-Doctor capable of accurately recognizing diseases by analyzing user-entered symptoms. By leveraging the capabilities of deep learning and neural networks, we aim to provide a valuable tool that can assist medical professionals and individuals in diagnosing health conditions efficiently and accurately.

### Key Features
- **Neural Network:** We have developed a neural network capable of processing symptom data and making disease predictions.

- **Symptom Input:** Users can enter their symptoms into the AI-Doctor, which will then analyze and provide possible disease diagnoses.

- **Medical Assistance:** Our artificial doctor aims to help citizens get a preliminary idea of their health status.

### How to Use
Our AI-Doctor documentation is designed to help you understand the project and how to interact with the AI-Doctor. In this repository, you'll find information on how to use the system, its architecture, training data, and more.

### Support and Feedback
We value feedback and suggestions. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvement, please open an issue in this repository.

Thank you for visiting our AI-Doctor Documentation repository. We are excited about the potential of this project to positively impact healthcare and medical diagnostics. Stay tuned for updates and enhancements!
